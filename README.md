ðŸš€ C/C++ Code Optimization Practice
Welcome to my C/C++ Code Optimization Practice repository!
This project is a personal collection of algorithms and code snippets written in C and C++, where I explore and implement techniques to write cleaner, faster, and more efficient code.

ðŸ§  Goals
Sharpen problem-solving and algorithmic thinking

Practice writing optimized code for speed and memory usage

Compare brute-force vs. optimized solutions

Analyze time and space complexity

Learn and apply compiler-specific optimization flags and profiling tools
